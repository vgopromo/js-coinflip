# js-coinflip
In this code, the player starts with a balance of $100 and can continuously play the coin flip game until they have no more money. The flipCoin function generates a random outcome of either heads or tails, and the startGame function allows the player to place a bet and updates their balance based on the outcome of the coin flip.
